Internet can be described as : 
- the basic hardware and software components that make up the internet
- a networking infrastructure that provides service to distributed applications

## What is a protocol

All activity in the internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.

A **protocol** defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

## The Network Edge

The computers and other devices connected to the internet are often referred to as **end systems** or **hosts**.

**End systems** are called **hosts** because they host (that is, run) application programs such as Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail reader program or an e-mail server program.

**Hosts** are further divided into **clients** and **servers**.

### Client and Server Programs

A **client program** is a program running on one end system that requests and receives a service from a **server program** running on another end system. Since, a client program typically runs on one computer and the server program runs on another computer, client-server Internet applications are, by definition **distributed applications**.

### Access Networks
