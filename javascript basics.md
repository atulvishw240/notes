## Variables

- `let`, can be re-assign
- `const` which we can't re-assign
- `var` isn't used anymore; behaved like `let` but had some quirks

## Numbers

**Order of Operations** (often remembered by acronyms like **PEMDAS** or **BODMAS**)
1. **Parentheses** (or Brackets) are evaluated first.
2. **Multiplication** and **Division** are done next, from left to right.
3. **Addition** and **Subtraction** are done last, from left to right.
