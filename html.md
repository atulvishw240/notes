Using the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your sites: how they are ranked in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.

## Void elements

Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag. These elements just have a single tag, like: `<br>` or `<img>`. They are known as void elements because they are void of any content, there is nothing inside of them. No closing tag means they can’t wrap content like other tags do.

>[!tip] We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our website `index.html`. This is because web servers will by default look for an `index.html` page when users land on our websites – and not having one will cause big problems.


## Head element

The `<head>` element is where we put important meta-information **about** our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser.

[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) ensure your markup is correct and are an excellent learning tool, as they provide feedback on syntax errors you may be making often and aren’t aware of, such as missing closing tags and extra spaces in your HTML.

## Images

>[!tip] It is a good habit to always specify height and width attributes in image tags as it helps the browser layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash.
>Although its better to set these via `CSS`.

>elements give meaning to **content** and **attributes** change the meaning of elements.
