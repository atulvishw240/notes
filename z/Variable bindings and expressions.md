## Semantics

- **Syntax** is just how you write something
- **Semantics** is what that something means
	- **Type checking** (before program runs)
	- **Evaluation** (as program runs)

For variable bindings:
- **Type check** expression and extend static environment
- **Evaluate** expression and extend dynamic environment

For every new expression you learn, ask:
- What's the syntax
- What are the type checking rules
- What are the evaluation rules
