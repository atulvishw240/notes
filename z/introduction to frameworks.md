Programmers, the best of whom are pretty lazy folk (in a good way), got tired of having to write the same code over and over and over again just to cover the basic tasks that they wanted their applications to perform. So they batched that recycled code together and called it a framework.

In addition to preventing repetition, frameworks provide great organization. (MVC)

## [How to select a web framework](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks#how_to_select_a_web_framework)

1. Effort to learn
2. Productivity
	1. Framework purpose/origin : Django was created to support development of a newspaper website
	2. Opinionated vs unopinionated
	3. Batteries included vs get it yourself
	4. Whether or not the framework encourages good development practices
3. Performance of the framework/programming language
4. Caching support
5. Scalability
6. Web security
