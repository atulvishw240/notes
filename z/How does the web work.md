## How does the internet work

Internet is the technical infrastructure and web is a service build on top of it. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.

>Inter-net - The term is made up of two words "inter" and "net" where, "inter" stands for **interconnected** and "net" stands for **networks**.

In order for two computers to start communication with each other, they need to be connected somehow. This connection can be done either by a physical wire or wirelessly (Wi-fi or Bluetooth).

Connecting two computers is easy but when you have to connect let's say 10 computers things will get complicated. You'll need 9 ports on each computer to connect it to other 9 computers. We know that a normal computer doesn't have this much ports.

So we'll connect each computer to another device called a *network switch*. If computer A wants to send message to computer B then it'll send the message to **network switch**, which then will send the message to only computer B.
