The strongest assets you can have as a student are a desire to build, a problem-solving mind, and persistence in the face of setbacks.

Once you start to feel comfortable with the tools, start contributing to open source projects, like [contributing to The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/contributing)! The more you contribute, the more you will learn about what you can do, and the closer you will get to being hireable. These projects will also look great on your resume!
