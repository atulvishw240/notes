## Motivation

>[!question] Why do I want to learn to program?

-  I want to earn well and afford all the things I want
- I like the location freedom it provides (remote work)
- I like that I can travel the world while working remotely
- I like how I can start my own business easily (SaaS, Freelancing, etc.)
- I like to work with smart people
- I like the dopamine rush I get, when I solve something challenging which is bugging me for a while
- I like the ability to create things (leverage)


## Growth mindset

I can get better at anything with **persistence** and **grit**.

Struggling with something is growth. It doesn’t matter how long you struggle with a concept or project; all that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through. That’s how real learning happens.

## The learning process

**Focus mode** and **diffuse mode**. Put effort into solving the problem first and then take a break (breakthroughs happen here).

**Learning loop** : Understand it, practice it, and finally teach it. (teaching can involve various forms like helping someone in the community in debugging)


## Managing your study time

>Build a habit of studying every day at a specific time and with a specific goal

Deadlines cause unneeded stress. Creating your own deadlines can lead to rushing through concepts that should not be rushed. There’s no way to know how long it will take you to learn how to query concepts to find your answers. There are no solid guidelines on that. 

If you’re doing The Odin Project because you need a high-paying job _right now_, you’re unlikely to become a solid developer within the timeframe you have set. Stress and anxiety absolutely do not help you learn either.


>[!important] Only compare yourself to your past self. Have your abilities and knowledge improved from where you were last week, last month, or last year? Be proud of the progress that you've made!
