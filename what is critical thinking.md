**Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly and rationally about what to do or believe.** Someone with critical thinking skills can do the following:

- Understand the logical connections between ideas
- Identify, construct, and evaluate arguments.  
- Detect inconsistencies and common mistakes in reasoning.  
- Solve problems systematically.  
- Identify the relevance and importance of ideas.  
- Reflect on the justification of one's own beliefs and values.


The essence of critical thinking is suspended judgment; and the essence of this suspense is inquiry to determine the nature of the problem before proceeding to attempts at its solution. This, more than any other thing, transforms mere inference into tested inference, suggested conclusions into proof. (Dewey *How We Think*)
