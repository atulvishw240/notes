The bottom layer of any web application is the database and it handles all the remembering (username and password)

A **relational database** is a database organized according to the _relational model_ of data. In simple terms, the relational model defines a set of relations and connections, between them in order to determine how the data stored in them can interact.

A **relational database management system**, or **RDBMS**, is essentially a software application, or system, for managing relational databases. There are many relational database management systems such as [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/), [MS SQL](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/default.aspx), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/).

**SQL**, which stands for _Structured Query Language_, is the programming language used to communicate with a relational database.

>SQL is a little different to other programming languages you may have encountered. SQL is a **declarative** language; when you write a SQL statement you describe _what_ needs to be done, but not exactly _how_ to do it -- the exact details of how the query is executed are handled internally by the RDBMS you are using.
