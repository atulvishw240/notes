Example: `man ls`

To navigate through the `man` pages, you may use `↑` and `↓` to move line-by-line, or try `b` and `Spacebar` to skip up and down by a full page. To search for a character or word in the `man` pages, use `/` followed by the character or word you are searching for. Sometimes a search will result in multiple hits. If so, you can move between hits using `N` (for moving forward) and `Shift+N` (for moving backward).
