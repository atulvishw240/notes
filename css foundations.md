## HTML and DOM (Document Object Model)

HTML has instructions on how the page should look like. HTML represents initial page content.

Each object of the tree is a node. DOM represents current page content.

## Padding, Border and Margin

- `padding` increases the space between the border of a box and the content of the box.
- `border` adds space (even if it’s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.
- `margin` increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.

## Block and Inline elements

>[!tip] In general, you do not want to try to put extra padding or margin on inline elements.


>Unlike other elements, `divs` and `spans` give no particular meaning to their content. They are just generic boxes that can contain anything.
